            <div class="text">We mainly take on people that have a degree or some sort of qualification in web design or computing. <br> But like Amanda we have exception where people are willing to take on a training and can take a course to get a qualification.</div>
            <div class="avaliablity">Since we are open we would like you to be able to work Monday through to Friday with the Saturday shift we are more understanding when people have families and children or who cannot work at the weekends.</div>
            <h2>Qualification</h2>
            <div class="info">For the qualification we would like at least a C up for you to work with us but if you have a grade lower than a C we have some courses linked to help people up their grades.</div>
            <div class="courses">You can easily apply for an online course like the open university so you are able to continue working whist getting the grade but there are other options like local colleges.</div>
            <div class="end">If you need anymore information please feel free to contact us at HotBeans@outlook.co.uk or our Instagram account HotBeans1offical.</div>
